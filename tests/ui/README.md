# Automated Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes the content of a directory and generates a report of the files and folders that are not in the expected format.

## Known UI Variations

### Button Text
Some buttons may have different text labels across different views:
- **Manual Analysis Trigger:** May appear as "Analyze Now", "Analyze", or "Trigger Analysis"
- Test selectors use regex patterns to accommodate these variations: `/Analyze Now|Analyze|Trigger Analysis/i`
