# ⚡ DO THIS NOW - Dashboard Fix

**Follow these exact steps. Don't skip any.**

---

## Step 1: Check What You Have

**Open Command Prompt:**
- Press `Win + R`
- Type: `cmd`
- Press `Enter`

**Run this command:**
```cmd
cd C:\DDN-AI-Project-Documentation
CHECK-SYSTEM.bat
```

**Look at the output and tell me:**
- Does it say "Node.js is installed" with ✅ or ❌?
- Does it say "Docker is installed" with ✅ or ❌?

---

## Step 2A: If Node.js Shows ✅ (YOU HAVE IT)

**Run these commands one by one:**

```cmd
cd C:\DDN-AI-Project-Documentation\implementation\dashboard-ui
```

Press Enter. Then:

```cmd
npm install
```

**Wait 2-3 minutes.** When it finishes, run:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

**You should see:**
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

**Click that link or open:** http://localhost:5173

**Done! Dashboard is running!**

---

## Step 2B: If Node.js Shows ❌ (YOU DON'T HAVE IT)

### Install Node.js First:

1. **Open this link:** https://nodejs.org/

2. **Download** the big green button that says "LTS"

3. **Run the installer**
   - Click Next
   - Click Next
   - Click Install
   - Wait...
   - Click Finish

4. **IMPORTANT: Close all terminals and open a NEW one**

5. **Test it worked:**
   ```cmd
   node --version
   ```

   Should show: `v18.x.x` or similar

6. **Now go to Step 2A above**

---

## Step 3: Verify Dashboard Works

**Open browser to:** http://localhost:5173

**You should see:**
- Big title: "DDN AI Test Failure Analysis Dashboard"
- Menu items: Dashboard, Failures, Analytics, Manual Trigger
- Clean, professional interface

**If you see that:** ✅ **SUCCESS!** Dashboard is running!

**If you see "Cannot GET /":** Wait 30 more seconds and refresh

**If you see error page:** Tell me what error you see

---

## If Still Not Working

### Tell me exactly:

1. **What does CHECK-SYSTEM.bat show?**
   ```
   (copy the output here)
   ```

2. **What command did you run?**
   ```
   (paste it here)
   ```

3. **What error/output did you see?**
   ```
   (paste it here)
   ```

---

## Alternative: Use Simple HTML Version

**If nothing works, open this file in browser:**

```
C:\DDN-AI-Project-Documentation\SIMPLE-HTML-DASHBOARD.html
```

**This shows:**
- System information
- Quick start commands
- All documentation links

**Not the full dashboard, but helps you see what you have!**
