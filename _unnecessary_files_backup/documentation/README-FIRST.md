## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Q: Do I need all API keys?

**A:** For full functionality, yes. But you can test the UI without them.

**Minimum to run:**
- Just Docker

**Minimum for AI analysis:**
- Anthropic API key (Claude)
- OpenAI API key (embeddings)
- Pinecone API key (vector search)

---

### Q: Can I use local MongoDB instead of Atlas?

**A:** Yes! Just press Enter when asked for connection string. Docker will start MongoDB locally.

---

### Q: How much does this cost to run?

**A:**
- Docker: Free
- MongoDB Atlas: Free tier (512MB)
- API usage: ~$0.05 per analysis (vs $1.50 before)

**Total:** Nearly free for development!

---

### Q: What if I don't have Jenkins?

**A:** You can still use manual trigger from Dashboard. Jenkins is only needed for auto-trigger.

---

### Q: Can I deploy to production?

**A:** Yes! See [DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md:1) for production deployment steps.

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Docker not found

**Install:** https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
**Restart** computer after installation

---

### Services won't start

```cmd
# Check Docker is running
docker --version

# Check what's running
docker ps

# View error logs
docker-compose logs
```

---

### Dashboard blank page

**Wait 3-5 minutes** for services to fully start

Then:
```cmd
docker-compose restart dashboard-ui
```

---

### MongoDB connection failed

**Check:**
1. Connection string format
2. Password URL-encoded (@ ‚Üí %40)
3. Network Access allows your IP
4. Database user exists

**Or:** Use local MongoDB (press Enter)
